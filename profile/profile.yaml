summary: "I graduated with a Master of Engineering degree from the University of Western Ontario and a Bachelor of Applied Science degree
from the University of Waterloo. I am very interested in the field of Data Science and Engineering due to its wide range of applications,
and I have professional experience in real time data analytics, machine learning algorithms in Python, and object oriented programming in Java.
Since starting with Jarvis, I have become comfortable working in an Agile/Scrum development cycle, have gained valuable experience with Linux,
PostgreSQL database management, and Java. I'm looking forward to getting the opportunity to put these tools to use along with my existing data
analysis and machine learning skills to make high quality software products with significant business impacts."

    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "Developed a Linux cluster hardware resource management tool in CentOS 7 intended to be used by Linux system administrators.
    The project includes a bash script to create and start a docker PostgreSQL container, and a SQL script to initialize the database and tables used
    to store system hardware and usage data. I wrote additional bash scripts to automatically collect the hardware and usage data, and persist
    the data into the PostgreSQL database provisioned with Docker. Finally, a crontab file was set up to execute the resource usage script every minute,
    and sample SQL commands were included to perform useful analytics on the data."

    description: "Created an interactive website to host various sorting and pathfinding algorithm visualizers,
    as well as some creative simulations written in JavaScript. The algorithm visualizers include sorting algorithms such as bubble sort,
    insertion sort, selection sort, quick sort, and merge sort, pathfinding algorithms such as Djikstra's Algorithm and A* Search, with an included
    recursive maze generator. The simulations include an ecosystem and evolution simulator, a gravity physics engine, and a boids flocking algorithm
    with quad tree optimization."
  - name: "City Neighbourhood Clustering Algorithm"
    git_url:
    description: "Built an unsupervised machine learning tool in Python with Jupyter Notebook to cluster areas (postal/zip codes) in a given city based on the area's facilities (restaurants, green space, schools, etc.).
    The algorithm resulted in 5 general clusters of postal codes (suburban, urban, industrial, downtown, airport). Analyzing the data revealed the most popular facilities in these clusters (e.g.
    Suburban areas were high in schools, green space, and yoga studios). The tool's intended use was to pinpoint the best location for a potential business owner to open their business (Suburban area
    with no yoga studios would have a demand for a new yoga studio). The tool was built using scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and matplotlib. The model was trained using data
    from Toronto, and tested on similar cities including Chicago, Boston, and London England, with yoga studios as a test case. All cities were found to have at least one neighbourhood with a demand for a new yoga
    studio, proving the feasibility of the tool."
  - name: "Oil Refinery Energy Cost Prediction Model"
    git_url:
    description: "Developed a large tool in MS Excel for compiling and analyzing process data for a large oil upgrader/refinery facility. Used various regression models on historic data
    to predict future energy costs. The tool was used to plan the annual energy budget for one of the largest oil and gas facilities in Canada. The tool consisted of
    19 regression models, one for each process unit in the facility. When used to predict test data, the models performed with a minimum R-squared value of 0.88, which
    was a significant improvement over the previous model."
