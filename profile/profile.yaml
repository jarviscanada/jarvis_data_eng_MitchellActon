summary: "Graduated with an Master of Engineering degree in Mechanical and Materials Engineering from the University of Western Ontario,
and a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Nanotechnology Engineering from the University of Waterloo. I gained exposure and experience
in data analytics and software development during school, during internships, through online courses, and through work experience after
graduating. Eventually this became my main focus at work, so I decided to formally make the switch to a full time software development
role with Jarvis. Since starting with Jarvis, I have become comfortable working in an Agile/Scrum development cycle, have gained valuable
experience with Linux, PostgreSQL database management, and Java. I'm looking forward to getting the opportunity to put these tools to use
along with my existing data analysis and machine learning skills to make high quality software products with significant business impacts."

    description: "Created an interactive website to host various sorting and pathfinding algorithm visualizers, as well as some creative simulations written in JavaScript."
  - name: "City Neighbourhood Clustering Algorithm"
    git_url:
    description: "Built an unsupervised machine learning tool in Python to cluster areas (postal/zip codes) in a given city based on the area's facilities (restaurants, green space, schools, etc.).
    The algorithm resulted in 5 general clusters of postal codes (suburban, urban, industrial, downtown, airport). Analyzing the data revealed the most popular facilities in these clusters (eg.
    Suburban areas were high in schools, green space, and yoga studios). The tool's intended use was to pinpoint the best area for a potential business owner to open their business (Suburban area
    with no yoga studios would have a demand for a new yoga studio)."
  - name: "Oil Refinery Energy Cost Prediction Model"
    git_url:
    description: "Developed a large tool in MS Excel for compiling and analyzing process data for a large oil upgrader/refinery facility. Used various regression models on historic data
    to predict future energy costs. The tool was used to plan the annual energy budget for one of the largest oil and gas facilities in Canada."
