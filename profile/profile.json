The algorithm resulted in 5 general clusters of postal codes (suburban, urban, industrial, downtown, airport). Analyzing the data revealed the most popular facilities in these clusters (eg. Suburban areas were high in schools, green space, and yoga studios). The tool's intended use was to pinpoint the best area for a potential business owner to open their business (Suburban area with no yoga studios would have a demand for a new yoga studio).",

  "summary": "Graduated with an Master of Engineering degree in Mechanical and Materials Engineering from the University of Western Ontario, and a Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Nanotechnology Engineering from the University of Waterloo. I gained exposure and experience in data analytics and software development during school, during internships, through online courses, and through work experience after graduating. Eventually this became my main focus at work, so I decided to formally make the switch to a full time software development role with Jarvis. Since starting with Jarvis, I have become comfortable working in an Agile/Scrum development cycle, have gained valuable experience with Linux, PostgreSQL database management, and Java. I'm looking forward to getting the opportunity to put these tools to use along with my existing data analysis and machine learning skills to make high quality software products with significant business impacts."
